## Overview

CGP 46 - cREAL oracle, freezing & constitution parameter activation


### Status

This proposal is meant to be executed on-chain before after [CGP-42](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0042.md) and [CGP-45](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0045.md). It enables the oracles designated to cREAL and sends 100 CELO to each of them to pay for gas for a couple of years.

It also does some administrative miscellaneous, namely

It also freezes the contracts StableTokenBRL and ExchangeBRL at the time of launch, it can 

## Proposed Changes

Fill out the following template for each transaction in the proposal

* Oracles
1. Set up oracle
  - Destination: SortedOracles
  - Data: SortedOracles.addOracle(TBD CREAL ADDRES, TBD ORACLE ADDRESS)
  - Value: 0
  - Notes: This will be repeated 10 times, one of each oracle address.
 2. The following ten transactions are to fund the oracles addresses mentioned in (1):
  - Destination: GoldToken.transfer
  - Data: SortedOracles.addOracle(TBD ORACLE ADDRESS, TBD ORACLE ADDRESS)
  - Value: 0 (it's actually `0` as this was implemented as a token transfer)
  - Notes: This will be repeated 10 times, one of each oracle address.
3. Freezing StableTokenBRL
  - Destination: Freezer.freeze
  - Data: StableTokenEUR (`address TBD`)
  - Value: 0
4. Freezing ExchangeBRL
  - Destination: Freezer.freeze
  - Data: ExchangeEUR (`address TBD`)
  - Value: 0
5. Set constitution value for ExchangeBRL.
  - Destination: Governance.setConstitution
  - Data: ExchangeBRL (`address TBD`), setRegistry ['0xa91ee0dc'], 0.9e24 = 900000000000000000000000

  - Value: 0
11. Set constitution value for StableTokenBRL.

  - Value: 0
13. Set constitution value for StableTokenBRL.
  - Destination: Governance.setConstitution

## Verification

An explanation of how voters can verify that this CGP does what it intends to do. Can be left as “TODO” until the proposal is made. Include things like CLI commands to run and pointers to code.

## Risks

Highlight any risks and concerns that may affect consensus, proof-of-stake, governance, protocol economics, the stability protocol, security, and privacy.
