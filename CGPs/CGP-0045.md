## Overview

CGP 45 - cBRL Activation

This proposal means to fully enable cBRL on-chain.

### Status

This proposal is meant to be submited after [CGP-42](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0042.md) passed and at least one sucessfull oracle report for cBRL has been made on-chain. At this point cBRL should already be created, but frozen and un-usable.

## Proposed Changes

1. Unfreezing ExchangeBRL
  - Destination: Freezer.unfreeze
  - Data: ExchangeBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
2. Unfreezing StableTokenBRL
  - Destination: Freezer.unfreeze
  - Data: StableTokenBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
3. Enable ExchangeBRL to pull money out of the reserve
  - Destination: Reserve.addExchangeSpender
  - Data: ExchangeBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
4. Adds StableTokenBRL as a token to be considered by the reserve
  - Destination: Reserve.addToken
  - Data: StableTokenBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
5. Enables cBRL as a gas currency
  - Destination: FeeCurrencyWhitelist.addToken
  - Data: StableToken(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0

## Verification

## Risks

* cBRL price risk: due to the low initial reserveFraction parameter, the initial expansion and contraction potential of cBRL supply is low which could lead to slow adjustments of cBRL supply after cBRL demand shocks. The impact of this is that it could take longer for cBRL to regain the peg after an extensive cBRL demand shock compared to a setup with a large reserveFraction parameter (similar to [CGP #7](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0007.md).
* cBRL reserve swap risk: The ability to exchange cBRL against Reserve assets may lead to depletion of the Reserve if oracles are not reflecting market prices accurately. Appropriate trade bucket sizes according to available market liquidity limit the extent of this risk.
