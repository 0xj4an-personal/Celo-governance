## Overview

This Governance intends to increase the amount of the buckets, as a percent of the total amount of the unfrozen Reserve Celo buckets. The concrete proposal is to lift the current bucket sizes to `X%` of the total unfrozen CELO in the Reserve.

Updating the bucket sizes means that Mento has more liquidity to provide to arbitragers, as well as making exchanges suffer less slippage, which could lead to a tighter peg. 

### Status
  
Currently, the parameter `reserveFraction` is set to 0.5%. This parameter was sufficient in the past, but as demand for Celo Stable assets has grown in the last few months, this parameter could be updated to be able to provide greater liquidity.

## Proposed Changes

Fill out the following template for each transaction in the proposal

1. Increase bucket size
  - Destination: `Exchange.setReserveFraction`
  - Data: TBD
  - Value: 0

2. Increase bucket size
  - Destination: `ExchangeEUR.setReserveFraction`
  - Data: TBD
  - Value: 0

## Verification

TODO

## Risks

* Higher bucket size means more funds at risk for the Reserve
* Granda Mento just launched, and it could potentially mean the extra liquidity proposed here is not actually needed for the time being.
