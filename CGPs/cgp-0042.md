## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade (not a) Release 6, which mainly proposes the activation of the `StableTokenBRL` and `ExchangeBRL` smart contracts.

TODO - Add link to release tag

### Status

Currently, only cUSD and cEUR are deployed on Mainnet.

## Proposed Changes

Fill out the following template for each transaction in the proposal

1. Deploy StableTokenBRLProxy
- Destination: Create new smart contract address for the Celo Real Proxy
- Data: 
- Value: 0

2. Deploy ExchangeBRLProxy
- Destination: Create new smart contract address for the ExchangeBRL proxy
- Data:
- Value: 0

3. Deploy StableTokenBRL
- Destination: Deploy StableTokenBRL implementation
- Data:
- Value: 0

4. Deploy ExchangeBRL
- Destination: Deploy ExchangeBRL implementation
- Data:
- Value: 0

5. *TDB: Oracle setting, freezing the contracts, setting constitution parameters.*

## Verification

### Initialization Parameters

https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/8831/files#diff-86731e83542c6add9baa6367e3ebb8d8c2cf6d7ab1036c3ba0d08cd13c9d5606

The reason is documented on this [ticket](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/7171) and the prescribed workaround is implemented in this [pr](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/7267) as a post `make-release` and pre `propose` step for the generated release proposals.

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. This proposal touches contracts which impact Celo's exchange. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.
