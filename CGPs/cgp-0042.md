```

The reason is documented on this [ticket](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/7171) and the prescribed workaround is implemented in this [pr](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/7267) as a post `make-release` and pre `propose` step for the generated release proposals.

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. This proposal touches contracts which impact Celo's exchange. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.
