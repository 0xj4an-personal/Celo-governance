## Overview
To encourage usage of the Celo Protocol and Ecosystem as well as facilitate transactions from Ethereum, proposing an allocation of CELO from the Community Fund for Airdrops. Specifically, users bridging assets from Ethereum to Celo via Optics would receive CELO in the form of an airdrop for transactions >$50. Given the high cost of gas fees required for bridging from Ethereum, many platforms like Avalanche have provided an airdrop that effectively subsidizes asset bridging. 

The actual airdrop amount should be determined and voted on by the community. In general though, it doesnâ€™t seem like the airdrop amount should be higher than ETH gas fees for security reasons to prevent potential DDOS attacks. 

Below is a potential framework to think about the total cost:
* Currently there are ~2-3 transactions per hour >$50. Assuming 8,760 hours in a year, that would be 17,520 to 26,280 bridge transactions per year. If each transaction receives an airdrop of, for example, $10, the cost of maintaining airdrops for 1 year would be $175,200 to $262,800 worth of CELO per year.

TBD: Airdrop Amount, which requires input from the community.
