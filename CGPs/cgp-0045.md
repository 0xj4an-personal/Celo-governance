## Overview

CGP 45 - cREAL Activation

This proposal is the third and final governance proposal needed launch cREAL. It was preceeded by [CGP-42](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0042.md) and [CGP-46](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0046.md).


### Status

This proposal should not be made until at least one oracle report for cREAL has been submitted. At this point, cREAL should already be deployed and initialized, but frozen and un-usable.

Please note `cREAL` was formelly called `cBRL`

## Proposed Changes

1. Unfreezing ExchangeBRL
  - Destination: Freezer.unfreeze
  - Data: ExchangeBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
2. Unfreezing StableTokenBRL
  - Destination: Freezer.unfreeze
  - Data: StableTokenBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
3. Enable ExchangeBRL to pull money out of the reserve
  - Destination: Reserve.addExchangeSpender
  - Data: ExchangeBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
4. Adds StableTokenBRL as a token to be considered by the reserve
  - Destination: Reserve.addToken
  - Data: StableTokenBRL(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
5. Enables cREAL as a gas currency
  - Destination: FeeCurrencyWhitelist.addToken
  - Data: StableToken(`TODO`)
  - Value: 0
6. Enable Granda Mento
  - Destination: GrandaMento.setStableTokenExchangeLimits
  - Data: ['StableTokenBRL', TODO, TODO]
  - Value: 0

## Verification

TODO after on-chain submission.

## Risks

* cREAL price risk: due to the low initial reserveFraction parameter, the initial expansion and contraction potential of cREAL supply is low which could lead to slow adjustments of cREAL supply after cREAL demand shocks. The impact of this is that it could take longer for cREAL to regain the peg after an extensive cREAL demand shock compared to a setup with a large reserveFraction parameter (similar to [CGP #7](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0007.md).
* cREAL reserve swap risk: The ability to exchange cREAL against Reserve assets may lead to depletion of the Reserve if oracles are not reflecting market prices accurately. Appropriate trade bucket sizes according to available market liquidity limit the extent of this risk.
