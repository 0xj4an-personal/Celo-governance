## Overview

### Objective

The key objective of this proposal is to aggressively position Celo at the forefront of the crypto space. To this end the Celo Ecosystem Treasury will energize activity around research and development in open-source, as well as through local communities and special projects utilizing this technology.

### Proposal Overview
The truest spirit of crypto and cypherpunk values is in embracing free and open source software (FOSS) technologies that can enable both the freedom to build and empowerment of humanity. This technology creates the foundation for everything we rely on in Web3, and that includes protocols like Celo and even Ethereum — which need vital support. Projects fostering more financial inclusion globally through crypto especially depend on open-source software at their foundation. The purpose of this fund won’t focus on looking for a call to grants to evaluate and fund on a specific funding category. Rather, this treasury will focus on funding research and special projects based on what is most critical to grow a crypto-native community globally, from developers to end users.

It will also be experimenting with ecosystem development by empowering locals in emerging markets who are leaders in their field to manage on-chain governance specific to their regions, using resources of the fund and boots-on-the-ground support.

### Areas of Focus
There are three key areas this effort will focus on (see Appendix for more information on targets).

* **Research and Development on Special Projects**: An allocation of the fund will go to funding exclusively open-source projects in Celo, Ethereum, and Web3 for long-term benefit to Celo, and can contribute back to the entire space via increasing community awareness and activity.
* **Ecosystem Development**: An allocation of the fund will focus on special boots-on-the-ground projects in emerging regions especially rooted in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the African continent, as well as special projects that bring a unique edge to the Celo platform through radical experimentation and embrace of the underlying technologies Celo employs. This can include experiments with NFTs, development in different languages, and entrepreneurship advocacy. This also includes wild card projects with the goal of pushing their particular field or discipline forward.
* **Community Empowerment**: An allocation of the fund will focus on empowering a crypto-savvy community for Celo, with many different projects that will enable people to use this underlying technology. This includes building a stronger governance working group, DAOs, promotion of events, more marketing and promotion of the community fund, and also finding more ways to educate on Celo + crypto. This also can include encouraging promotional material like newsletters, more public advocacy, and more grassroots meme generation.

### Structure

#### Multisig
4 out of 7 multisig controlled by the following individuals:
* Lead - Yaz Khoury, cLabs **(Multisig: TBA**)
* Jarrell James, cLabs **(Multisig: TBA)**
* Eric Nakagawa, cLabs **(Multisig: TBA)**
* Gab Micheletti, ProsperDAO **(Multisig: TBA)**
* Medha Kothari, Variant Fund + she256 **(Multisig: TBA)**
* Maya Zehavi **(Multisig: TBA)**
* Elizabeth Barnes, Figment **(Multisig: TBA)**

#### Budget

The CGP is requesting 3 Million CELO from the Community Fund.


#### Additional Information

The setup can mimic the CCF proposal where the on-chain Community Fund can withdraw those funds if they are left unused after a time by a future governance proposal.
 
#### Compensation

We propose for the equivalent of $100/hr payable in cUSD from the CET’s CELO holdings, within a cap of 30 hrs/week, be paid as compensation for the administrative operations of the CET. The funds for both the program and the administrative pay will be allocated upfront to the CET multisig from the on-chain Celo Community Fund treasury. In line with this proposal’s commitment to the community, all hours and activities of program operations will be logged publicly and transparently.

### First 90 Days Plan of Action

Given the Celo Ecosystem Treasury (CET) is going to focus heavily on funding large scale projects where other community funds and grant programs had a smaller scale, this is the plan for the first 30-90 Days with the activation of the CET.

The CET aims to immediately put the funds to good use funding ecosystem and open-source projects.

In the first 30 Days, the CET will:
* Reach out to 5 projects from the categories listed in the Appendix to begin conversation on support and scoping out funding requirements.

In the first 90 Days, the CET will:
* Fund at least 1 project in each high-level category from those listed in the Appendix.

### Marketing Challenges

Celo currently suffers from perception issues because we forked Geth and use shallow marketing terms like being EVM-compatible, without historically contributing much to improve the EVM. Donut added some new hash functions for Solidity developers, but we need to do a lot more than just that. This allows us to walk the walk. We also aren’t seeing enough projects with boots-on-the-ground engagements in emerging regions to foster education around how to use and build smart contracts, as well as how to best use on-chain governance for needs within those particular regions.
 
With this proposal, we will bolster marketing for Celo to crypto-savvy folks and locals in emerging markets, while promoting the on-chain community fund and encouraging more awareness of it.
 
### Proposal Risks

We have identified the following risks:

* People may perceive a sponsorship or grant as “pay to play”. We must work to limit the perception of Celo’s monetary support of projects as a way to control a project’s roadmap. We would also specifically state in clear terms how such contributions are viewed, and that they are done without an expectation from the engineering team to prioritize Celo specific interests.
* Another team tries to turn this effort into a marketing effort. The contributions are for the benefit of the entire developer community and the ecosystems we are focused on, so we should use this to show our leadership in the crypto space and for emerging regions.

## Verification

TBD
